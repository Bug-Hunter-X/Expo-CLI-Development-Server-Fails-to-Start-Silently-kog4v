While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server wouldn't start correctly.  The CLI showed no errors, but the app wouldn't load in the Expo Go app, and the metro bundler seemed to hang. I tried restarting the computer, clearing the cache, and reinstalling Expo CLI but none of these worked. This was happening consistently across different projects and on different devices.
