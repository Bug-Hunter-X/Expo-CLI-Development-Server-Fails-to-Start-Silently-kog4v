# Expo CLI Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server fails to start without providing any clear error messages. The issue occurs consistently across multiple projects and devices.  Standard troubleshooting steps, including cache clearing and reinstallation, have proven ineffective.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe that the development server does not start, the bundler appears to hang.  No specific error messages are reported in the console.

## Potential Causes

- Possible conflict with other processes or system settings. 
- A rare edge case within the Expo CLI itself. 
- A problem with a specific package or dependency within one of the projects.

## Solution (See expoBugSolution.js)
The issue is likely due to a background process or system resource conflict that is not explicitly reported by Expo CLI. The solution presented in `expoBugSolution.js` involves a series of checks and actions to identify and potentially mitigate the problem. This improved troubleshooting process helps narrow down the underlying issue.
